# sd-forge-scriptrun
Start external scripts as a script extension from inside SD Forge WebUI

Install using "from url" with: https://github.com/zeittresor/sd-forge-scriptrun/tree/main/sd-forge-scriptrun

btw. some (external) scripts might not work correctly because of missing repositorys of a local venv folder. IMHO

btw. #2: ignore the example it use external repositorys. :-/
